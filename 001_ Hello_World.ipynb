    "# Lesson 1 - Hello World!\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Welcome to the World of Python**\n",
    "\n",
    "You may have heard a lot about Python as a coding language. In the last twenty years, Python has gained a strong and loyal following of coders and data scientists. It is powering companies such as Facebook and Google, and it is the basis of more data analytics programming than any other language. \n",
    "\n",
    "***Python is a versatile language.*** With Python, you can build apps, make websites or run complex statistical modelling. With Python, you can produce complex data visualizations and teach computers to read just like we read a book or document. \n",
    "\n",
    "***Python is simple.*** Of the professional languages that you will encounter in your coding life, Python is known to be one of the easiest for beginners. Its syntax is straightforward and human friendly. Unlike more complex languages such as C, C++ or C#, Python's syntax and commands are built to make sense to English speakers. While this is not always true, it is in most cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Getting the Most Out of The Lessons**\n",
    "The lessons we will produce will be in Jupyter Notebooks. You are in your first Jupyter notebook right now. This entire lesson is done in one Jupyter Notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Notebooks are the preferred work environment for writing Python code. Jupyter Notebooks are part of a group of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs - you will see this term quite a bit in your coding career). IDEs are software tools (or environments) to construct and test your code. Unlike other Python IDEs, such as Atom, Spyder, PyCharm and others, Jupyter Notebook allows you to test your whole code or blocks of code simply. Jupyter Notebooks allow you to easily document your code and add extensive notes (such as this introduction) without affecting the code. Making notes in plain English (or your native language) in your code is called ***documenting your code.*** \n",
    "\n",
    "In the thrill of the coding moment, you will do amazing things in code. But the next day, after you have come out of *the zone* of coding, you will look back on your code and not remember what you were doing or how you were solving the problem. Sure, you can spend time re-reading your code to figure it out, but why do that when you can add in human-friendly words an explanation on what you are doing. \n",
    "\n",
    "Documentation within code is great for you the next day or next week when you return to the code, but you will not always be the only person reading your code. Your documentation helps other coders who come after you to understand what you were doing. (*NOTE: You will spend more time reading other people's code than you will do writing your own code over the length of your coding career. Expend a few hours with someone else's code who has not documented their code, and you will definitely come to appreciate good documentation. Don't be one of THOSE coders who don't document!*)\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks make documenting your code easy and straight forward. \n",
    "\n",
    "## **Let's Write Our First Program**\n",
    "\n",
    "Coding tradition states that the first program every coder should write for good luck in their career with that language is \"Hello World!\". \n",
    "\n",
    "In 1983, when Macintosh was introduced to the world, the first words spoken from that glorious little beige box with the tiny monochromatic screen was \"Hello World!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Take a look at this next block of code. See if you can predict what it is going to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you are ready, select the block then click RETURN + SHIFT. This command (RETURN + SHIFT) tells Jupyter Notebook to run the block of code. "
